  _conversation:
  - Ho there, traveller! I'm afraid there is only me to offer welcome. Our town's
    fallen quiet you see.
  - Used to be there was a great kingdom beneath our town. It's long fell to ruin,
    yet it stll draws folks into its depths.
  - Well watch out. It's a sicky air that fills the place. Creatures turn mad and
    travellers are robbed of their memories.
  - Perhaps dreams aren't such great things after all...
