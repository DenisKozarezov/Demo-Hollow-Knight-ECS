## About Prototype

This prototype is a collaboration of students of Moscow State Technical universities. The purpose of the prototype is to work out the ***ECS*** architectural pattern on the example of the ```Hollow Knight``` metroidvania. All assets were downloaded from free sources, all rights belong to Team Cherry.

## Programming Patterns

The prototype uses the following architectural patterns:
1. ```ECS``` — we use a convenient lightweight framework called [LeoECS](https://github.com/Leopotam/ecs?ysclid=lbqlvnm2pp728702370), which provides a minimal API for fast work.
2. ```Behaviour Tree``` — custom framework with an editor to provide a simple AI. You can see our implementation in this [folder](https://github.com/DenisKozarezov/Demo-Hollow-Knight-ECS/tree/main/Packages/com.korolev.uilityai-package).
